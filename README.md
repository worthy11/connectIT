# ðŸ”ºconnectITðŸ”º

connectIT is a domain-specific language designed for describing and visualizing 3D modular origami structures. With an intuitive syntax, it enables creators to define units, layers, and complex folded shapes programmatically. <br />

## ðŸ”ºFeatures
- Declarative Syntax â€“ Define origami models using intuitive language constructs.
- Arithmetic & Logic Operations â€“ Perform calculations and comparisons.
- Loops & Conditionals â€“ Control structures for procedural generation.
- Functions & Recursion â€“ Define reusable patterns.
- Real-time Visualization â€“ Render 3D models using Plotly. <br />

## ðŸ”ºExample Code
```
LAYER first = UNIT(red) * 3;
LAYER second = UNIT(green) * 2;
LAYER third = UNIT(blue) * 1;

CONNECT second TO first;
MODE between;
SHIFT 0;

FORMS SHAPE pyramid;
CONNECT third EXTENDS pyramid;
```

## ðŸ”ºSetup
### Installing Dependencies

Ensure you have Python and ANTLR4 installed:

```
pip install antlr4-python3-runtime plotly
```

### Cloning the Repository

```
